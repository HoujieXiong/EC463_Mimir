### Description
Our wearable device aims to assist the visually impaired with real-time guidance
regarding their surroundings. Utilizing a camera, speaker, microphone and artificial intelligence, the device will be able to recognize people, obstacles, and the environment and dictate the information back to the user. We will also incorporate cloud computing to assist in our computational power without sacrificing form factor. Through a focus on comfort and functionality, we aim to empower visually impaired individuals to be able to navigate the world more easily utilizing an intuitive and unobtrusive design. <br>

### Current State of Mimir
For our current state of Mimir, we were able to attach multiple components to our main source, the Raspberry Pi 5 (RPi 5), and build on top of it to create our new assistive technology. As of right now, we currently have multiple components attached to the RPi 5, such as our LiDAR, RPi Camera, tactile buttons attached via soldered jumper wires. For hardware components, the LiDAR camera is attached via externally with a USB C wire attached to the RPi 5. The RPi Camera is attached via the RPi 5's connector. Tactile buttons are attached externally and are controlled by using GPIO pins with two sets of jumper wires soldered together. The software runs on the RPi 5 at the most optimized speeds in order to compute and deliver promptly feedback for proper user-device interactions. <br>


### Future Iterations of Mimir
In future iterations, we plan to implement newer features to allow more interactive components to further provide visually impaired individuals more accessibility while performing other daily tasks, such as laundry, driving, and other personal care to name a few. Mimir aims to provide visually impaired individuals more independence and opportunities to live a better quality of life. <br>
