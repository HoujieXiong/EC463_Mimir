# Mimir: Hardware Components
For our hardware of Mimir, we have multiple components that is connected our computing source, Raspberry Pi 4.  The components consists of <br>
```
    - Raspberry Pi 4
    - LiDAR Camera 
    - Raspberry Pi Camera
    - Battery Pack for RPi 4
    - M/F Jumper Wires
    - Tactile Buttons
    - USB Microphone
```
Combining all these components create our assistive device, Mimir. Most of our choices in designing our hardware of the device was mostly centered around out iniative towards having high computing power to process and perform multithreading of features and functions, such as our image processing, cloud client-server interactions, and hardware inputs/outputs. Which is why we mostly focused on using the Raspberry Pi 5, but evnetually switched to the Raspberry Pi 4 instead, due to the better capacity in maintining our various inputs/outputs.
